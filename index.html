                        <p>I am very happy today as my school team won the first position in inter-school debate competition in the city last week. As many as 60 students from 15 States participated in it. The topic of the debate was ‘Has Demonetization Achieved Its Goals?’ I spoke in favour of the motion. I gave arguments to support my debate. I quoted facts and figures quite confidently. The best part was the judges liked my expression and presentation. At the end I was given a thundering applause. I was so happy when my name was announced for the first position. At school also I received so much praise and appreciation from the principal. My parents were also very happy at my achievement.</p>

                        <p>Oh a what feeling winning the inter school match of football. And we winning after nearly 3 years that's really fascinating. I cant even say how much happy I am. I am getting crazy we are leading the series 1:2.we are already brought the series in our hands. Our coach is taking us for a resort party if we win the upcoming game the day after. I can't even wait. I will never mind if I forget my chewing gum theres no pressure but our eye will be on the clean sweep. That's really like what I cannot forgot the moment our team was in the goal of 6:5 they fought back really hard. At a time we we're 4:5 then I made back to back goals. And every one throwed me high into the sky. I cant even expect this happened and my next match is on my birthday wow if I be the man to save my time I will die with happiness. I can't forgot that day. I hope the next match goes well</p>

                        <p class="list-group-item-text">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                        <p class="list-group-item-text">Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students’ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum’s subjects. As soon as you enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters login detail</p>
